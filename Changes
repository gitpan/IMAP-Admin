1.0.1 Don't remember

1.2.0 Thu Mar 02 11:24:13 2000
	- applied quoting fixes from mah@everybody.org this seems to have
	  gotten rid of the lingering issues with having spaces and other such
	  characters in folder names (thanks also for the cruft fixes :)
	- cleaned up code and documentation
	- added quota test

1.2.1 Thu Mar 02 12:04:13 2000
	- added none option to set_quota to set the quota to none

1.2.2 Sun Mar 12 21:16:38 2000
	- Added a license line for the debian folks, This module is distributed
	  under the Artistic license which is now included in the module
	  package (its the same as the perl license)
	  If you do use this is a product just drop me a line and let me know,
	  curiosity kills my cat.

1.2.5 Thu Jun 22 08:03:04 2000
	- bug fix for delete mailboxes with spaces from patrick@secureops.com
	- above bug fix made me look at other mailbox issues so 
	  getacl is also fixed with regards to mailboxes with spaces

1.3.0 Tue Aug 22 20:39:34 2000
	- typo fix (left out tilde in get_quota_root) thanks to
	  Paul Wiechman and Alain Turbide
	- a previous fix seems to have broken some things with cyrus users
	  so hopefully this fixes my fix

1.3.5 Thu Sep 28 17:09:02 2000
	- added subscribe/unsubscribe at the request of the applications
	  group of Universal Talkware (apparently makes mozilla
          e-mail happier)

1.3.7 Fri Oct 13 00:21:11 2000
	- added rename at the request of Thomas Bolioli
	- added h_delete (hiearchical delete) because I like just
	  being able to specify the mailbox and have all the
	  sub-mailboxes go away as well (be careful with this
	  as it does do a wild card list)
	- added new option to the new function 'Separator', set this
	  to the hiearchical separator your server uses (defaults to period)
	  this is needed by h_delete

1.3.8 Wed Oct 25 11:50:49 2000
	- fixed a 'bug' in list for servers that don't quote mailboxes
	  that have spaces in folder names
	- fixed a bug in test that I introduced in 1.3.7

1.4.0 Thu Oct 26 11:59:56 2000
	- added SSL support via IO::Socket::SSL (optional new function).
	  imap::admin doesn't attempt to load IO::Socket::SSL until you
	  specify that you want to use ssl (so if you don't have it
	  installed on your box it shouldn't make a difference)
	- rearranged code so croaks do not happen for connection issues,
	  instead you get an error from initialize code when you try to
	  do a command. (This is to help all of those people using this
	  in cgi scripts)
	- in supporting ssl I had to switch to sysreads, so now all reads
	  are handled by _read (still doesn't select, but getting closer)
 	- currently it doesn't check for ssl capability (rfc2595 compliance),
	  but maybe in the future

1.4.1 Thu Oct 26 13:35:17 2000
	- bug fix (thanks to Thomas Bolioli) for single quotes in a 
	  mailbox name

1.4.2 Thu Nov  9 22:31:08 2000
	- rearranged new/initialize (no functionality change)
	- added error subroutine to return error condition

1.4.3 Tue Nov 28 07:50:56 2000
	- bug report/fix (thanks to Marc Groot Koerkamp) get_acl had problems
	  with spaces in mailbox names (my forever bug)
	- bug report/fix (again thanks to Marc) delete was calling incorrect read
	  function
